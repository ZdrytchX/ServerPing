# NS2-ServerPing-in-Numeric-Form
Fixes up the server list menu into something that actually gives value. Australians don't just see silly red bars.

TODO:

-scale player count by colours rather than predefined colours like shown with the pings

-fix top layer categories (remove the server index number thingy which means absolutely nothing, and change over PERF to HIVESK or something

-increase compatability with other UI related mods (currently this mod isn't compatible with other server browser related mods)
